## Project Overview

I designed the survey form  to demonstrate my understanding of HTML and CSS concepts. It showcases my ability to create a responsive form using various form elements, such as text inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons, and a submit button.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `index.html` - The main HTML file containing the survey form structure.
- `styles.css` - The CSS file that styles the survey form.
